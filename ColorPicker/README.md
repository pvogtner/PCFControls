This control utilizes React and the Office-Ui-Fabric to allow a user to pick a color and update the text field that the control is bound to.

Note - Image above shows the color field twice so that you see that the field is being updated.

## Properties

* `inputValue` (string, required): The field value bound to the control.
* `defaultColor` (string, required): Default color shown when the bound field is blank. Use hex format (e.g. `#ffffff`).
