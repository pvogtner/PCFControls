* Open the **Code components** area in the Insert panel and add the **RAW! PDF Form Fill (Canvas)** component to the form.  The control itself will just be a blank space on the form.  It is suggested you rename the Component you dropped on the form to make it easier to access.

* Click on the Component on the form and set the Properties for the component.
    * pdfTemplate (string): This will be the file name which the browser will download the content as.
    * fillPDF (bool): Set this to true to kick off the PDF form fill.
    * Items (Collection): This is the collection of items which will fill the form.  It needs to be a JSON Collection where each object has two fields name and data (these are case sensitive).  The name field will be the name of the PDF form field and data is the content that will be put in that field.
    ``
        ClearCollect(TestCollect, 
        {name: "Name", data: ThisItem.'Full Name'},

    * outputErrorMessage (string, output): Error message if the fill process fails.
    * outputError (bool, output): Will be **true** when an error occurs during filling.
